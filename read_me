1.  0x595a69Ce32A1Cc4DbA7A600CBb090f336E9bE322  - new contract address

2.  abi.js  - is a new abi

3. functions_only.js  - contains only the functions that you can pick without copying the whole page. 

   Each function now gives a responce -an object with the exact data 
  
   Each function has a bubble_fn that is commented out.

   Each  bubble_fn function's object is already JSON.Stringified

   But it's better if we deal with the functions when we are live
